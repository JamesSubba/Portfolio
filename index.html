        <h2>ðŸ“œ Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is James Subba and I am a 3rd BScIT student at Gyalpozhing College of Information Technology.
          I am a full stack developer who is really interested in learning new technologies and building 
          new projects using them. Currently I am skilled in MERN and RE-FI tech-stack and have build few 
          projects with them. Besides those things I have also experimented with technologies such as 
          Solidity and Unity.
